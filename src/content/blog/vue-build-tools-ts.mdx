When you get started you will want to setup build for TypeScript if needed later even if for now you prefer to stick with Javascript. 

Modify the `compilerOptions` of the 'tsconfig.json' file. Simply make sure you have the `allowJs` option set to `true`


```json
{
  "files": [],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true
  },
}
```
